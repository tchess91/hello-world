# hello-world

Hello all,

I am Traivs. I am currently attending UMUC in pursuit of a B.S. in Computer Science. I wish to become a programmer or software engineer in near future. I am still learning more languages and new techniques and any help with my projects is welcomed and greatly appreciated. Thank you and I look forward to working with many people and sharing thoughts and experience.
